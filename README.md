# Decentralized Voting System

## Project Description
This project is a decentralized voting system built on Ethereum using Solidity smart contracts. It allows an admin to register candidates and users to cast votes in a transparent and tamper-proof way.

## Project Vision
To create a transparent, censorship-resistant voting platform that can be used for elections, polls, or any decision-making process needing fairness and decentralization.

## Key Features
- Admin-controlled candidate registration
- One vote per voter enforced on-chain
- Transparent vote counting and storage
- Event emitted on every vote for easy off-chain tracking

## Future Scope
- Add delegation and proxy voting
- Integrate token-based voting weights
- Enable multiple voting rounds and proposals
- Add voter registration with identity verification
- Build front-end interface for user interaction
